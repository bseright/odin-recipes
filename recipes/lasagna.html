    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A rich and creamy whole-wheat pasta dish filled layer by 
    layer with refreshingly fresh onions and garlic, lathered in 
    a succulent sauce and topped with imported, premium quality mozzarella.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet italian sausage</li>
        <li>3/4 point lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Many more items that I refuse to list</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, 
            onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. 
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, 
            and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian 
            seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. 
            Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
            lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles,
            and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta 
            cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Many steps that I don't care to list.</li>
