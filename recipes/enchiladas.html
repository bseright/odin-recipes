    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>An enchilada is a corn tortilla rolled around a filling and covered 
        with a savory sauce. Originally from Mexican cuisine, enchiladas can
        be filled with various ingredients, including meats, cheese, beans,
        potatoes, vegetables, or combinations.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/4 white onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>Many more items that I refuse to list</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine chicken breast with chicken broth, one 
            quarter onion, a clove of garlic, and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring 
            to a boil, and then boil for 20 minutes. Reserve broth, set 
            chicken aside to cool, and discard onion and garlic. When cool enough to 
            handle, shred chicken with your hands.</li>
        <li>Place tomatillos and serrano chiles in a pot with water, enough to cover
            them. Bring to boil, and continue boiling until tomatillos turn a different 
            shade of green (from bright green to a dull, army green). Strain tomatillos 
            and chiles, and place in a blender with another quarter piece of onion, 1 
            clove garlic, and a pinch of salt. Pour in reserved chicken broth, so that 
            liquid just covers the veggies in the blender by about an inch. Blend all 
            ingredients until they are completely pureed. Pour salsa in a medium saucepan,
            and bring to a low boil.</li>
        <li>Pour oil in a frying pan, and allow to get very hot. Slightly fry tortillas 
            one by one in hot oil, setting each on a paper towel afterwards to soak some 
            of the oil. Finally, dip slightly fried tortillas in low-boiling green salsa,
            until tortillas become soft again. Place on plates, 3 per person.</li>
        <li>Many steps that I don't care to list.</li>
