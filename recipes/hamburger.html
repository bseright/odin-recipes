    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A hamburger is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of
        ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crushed saltine crackers</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>Many more items that I refuse to list</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Set out a large mixing bowl. Add in the ground beef, crushed 
            crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, salt, garlic powder, 
            onion powder, and pepper. Mix by hand until the meat mixture 
            is smooth, but stop once the mixture looks even. (Overmixing 
            can create a dense heavy texture.).</li>
        <li>Press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife
             to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 1/3 pound 
             grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties.</li>
        <li>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold 
            the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly 
            into patties. Shape them just slightly larger than the buns you plan 
            to use, to account for shrinkage during cooking. Set the patties 
            on the baking sheet. Use a spoon to press a dent in the center of
             each patty so they don't puff up as they cook. If you need to 
             stack the patties separate them with a sheet of wax paper.</li>
        <li>Many steps that I don't care to list.</li>
